//! This crate allows you to rougly limit the amount of time taken by a repetitive task.
//!
//! For this crate to work well, the task you're doing should take a reasonably consistent amount of time.
//!
//! ```
//! # extern crate soft_time_limit;
//! # use soft_time_limit::TimeLimiter;
//! # use std::time::Duration;
//! # struct ThingToDo(u32);
//! # let mut game_over = false;
//! let mut limit = TimeLimiter::new();
//!
//! // outer game / simulation loop:
//! while !game_over {
//!     // Each frame, we want to perform some number of time-consuming tasks,
//!     // without using up too much time. We'll give our tasks a time budget
//!     // of 3ms.
//!     limit.repeat_with_budget(Duration::from_millis(3), || {
//!         // This closure will be called repeatedly, until it returns false
//!         // or we predict that we're going to overshoot our time limit.
//!
//!         // ... do something expensive ...
//!
//!         // return whether we want to be invoked again.
//!         # let more_tasks_to_do = false;
//!         return more_tasks_to_do;
//!     });
//!     # break;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Another example, processing items from a queue:
//!
//! ```
//! # extern crate soft_time_limit;
//! # use soft_time_limit::TimeLimiter;
//! # use std::time::Duration;
//! # struct ThingToDo(u32);
//! # let mut game_over = false;
//! let mut queue = vec![ThingToDo(1), ThingToDo(2)];
//! let mut limit = TimeLimiter::new();
//! while !game_over {
//!     limit.repeat_with_budget(Duration::from_millis(3), || {
//!         if !queue.is_empty() {
//!             let thing_to_do = queue.pop();
//!             // ... do expensive task with thing_to_do ...
//!         }
//!         let is_done = !queue.is_empty();
//!         is_done
//!     });
//!     # break;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If you have multiple tasks you want to limit, you should create a *separate* `TimeLimiter` for each task.
//! That is, you should never call two different closures with the same `TimeLimiter`.
//!
//! You can also explicitly manage the time frame you have available:
//!
//! ```
//! # extern crate soft_time_limit;
//! # use soft_time_limit::TimeLimiter;
//! # use std::time::Duration;
//! # let mut game_over = false;
//! let mut limit = TimeLimiter::new();
//! while !game_over {
//!     // 5ms time limit for our task:
//!     let mut frame = limit.frame(Duration::from_millis(5));
//!     while frame.have_time() {
//!         // the time a task takes is measured from the creation to the drop of this handle
//!         // make sure you don't assign to _, it will be dropped immediately if you do
//!         let _task = frame.time_task();
//!         // ... do expensive task ...
//!         # break;
//!     }
//!     # break;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note: This crate is very low-overhead and never invokes thread sleeps;
//! it just chooses whether to call your function or not based on the system time.
//! However, it won't magically make your tasks faster.
//! You'll still need to make sure they complete in a reasonable amount of time ðŸ˜‰
